# Fan Contributions to Nature of Code 2.0
This repo contains examples based on Daniel Shiffman's [Nature of Code 2.0](https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/nature-of-code/) book and video series.

If you want the actual theory behind the topics, visit Daniel's YouTube channel [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) or buy the revised version of his _Nature of Code 2.0_ book that he hopes to release later in 2021.

The point of this repo is to function as a playground for me and perhaps offer another perspective on how you could do the actual programming. Whereas Daniel's focus is on the physics and algorithms from his book, this repo will focus more on composing examples from several topics into single projects and programming topics like unit testing.

Having said that, I am no accomplished JavaScript programmer or test master. So don't shoot me if I don't do things perfectly ;)
